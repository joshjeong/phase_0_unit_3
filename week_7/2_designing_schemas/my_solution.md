## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling:
one to one: each employee has only one cubicle
one to many: an employee can only belong to one company but a company can have many employees

## Release 5: Reflection
First time building a table in SQL designer. It was cool to create visual depiction and connect them using foreign keys. I'm curious to see how we can call for information from multiple tables.
